This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of machine learning algorithms, implemented using widely adopted libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and others. The primary objective is to offer both an accessible, high-level implementation of fundamental algorithms and demonstrate their practical applications across a diverse range of tasks, including classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. Additionally, this work is informed by my extensive experience in **Kaggle competitions**, where I have rigorously applied these techniques to complex, real-world datasets. This has deepened my understanding of the algorithms' capabilities and nuances, particularly in solving challenging and varied machine learning problems.

Furthermore, I have participated in a **hackathon**, where I collaborated with a multidisciplinary team to build an innovative machine learning solution under tight time constraints. This experience has honed my problem-solving and collaboration skills, as well as my ability to rapidly prototype and implement RAG system in a high-pressure environment.

I have also undertaken a comprehensive **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) test**, which involved evaluating and fine-tuning models that combine retrieval-based and generative techniques. This experience provided valuable insights into the potential and limitations of hybrid models, which can significantly enhance performance on tasks such as question answering, summarization, and other natural language processing challenges.
