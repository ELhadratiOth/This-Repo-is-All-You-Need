AI solves problems humans struggle with, such as decision-making and language translation.  Examples include IBM's Watson, which uses machine learning for accurate predictions, and AI software used for cancer diagnosis, facial emotion recognition, and information retrieval.  Future videos will explore AI and future technologies."
